# Deterministic sample builders for the design / dispatch / validation tests.
# Phase 1 ships no estimator, so these carry no estimation truth -- they exist
# to give the design layer realistic case-control / NCC / case-cohort data to
# validate and route. Later phases replace / extend this with a cohort DGP that
# has known causal truth and samples designs from it.

# A matched case-control / NCC sample: `n_sets` matched sets, each with exactly
# one case and `ratio` controls, so every set is informative for the
# conditional likelihood. Columns: case (0/1), x (binary exposure), age, smoke,
# set (matched-set id), t (a time scale for NCC / case-cohort).
